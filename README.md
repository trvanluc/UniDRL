**UniDRL (University Discipline & Engagement Management System)** is a frontend-only web application developed as an **academic prototype** to digitally manage student event participation, attendance tracking, and discipline point evaluation (*Điểm Rèn Luyện*).

The system replaces traditional paper-based workflows with a modern **QR-code–driven process**, improving transparency, efficiency, and traceability for both students and administrators.

> ⚠️ **Academic Disclaimer**
> This project is developed strictly for educational purposes. It uses **LocalStorage** as a mock persistence layer and does not include a real backend system.
> It is **not intended for production use** without additional backend, authentication, and security mechanisms.

## 🔭 Overview

### Background

In many universities, student activity participation and discipline point evaluation (*Điểm Rèn Luyện*) are still handled manually using paper attendance sheets and post-event data entry. These approaches are inefficient, error-prone, and lack transparency for students.

### Problem Statement

* Time-consuming manual check-in processes
* Paper waste and poor data traceability
* Limited visibility for students regarding participation history
* High risk of errors or fraudulent attendance records

### Proposed Solution

UniDRL digitizes the entire workflow using a **QR-based event management model**:

1. Digital event registration and QR ticket generation
2. Real-time QR-based check-in verification
3. QR-based checkout combined with post-event evaluation
4. Automated participation tracking and badge assignment

### Target Users

* **Students**
  Register for events, use QR tickets, and track participation history (*My Journey*).

* **Admin (Unified Role)**
  Manage events, participants, QR scanning, badge rules, and reports.

> ℹ️ *Note on role design:*
> At the current development stage, roles such as **Advisor** and **Manager** are **not separated**. All administrative responsibilities are grouped under a single **Admin** role. This design choice simplifies implementation for an academic prototype. Role-based authorization is planned for future expansion.

## ⚡ Installation

### Prerequisites

* Modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
* Visual Studio Code
* Live Server extension (recommended)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trvanluc/UniDRL.git
   cd UniDRL
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

3. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

4. Access the application in your browser:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
   ```

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> Running via a local server is required due to ES6 Module restrictions. Opening HTML files directly will cause module loading errors.

2. Browse available events
3. Register for an event to receive a QR ticket
4. Present the QR code for event check-in
5. Scan the Admin’s checkout QR at event end
6. Complete the post-event Q&A evaluation
7. Receive a badge and updated participation history

### 🛡️ Admin Workflow

1. Create and manage events
2. Scan student QR codes for check-in

  else Invalid
    System-->>Admin: Error
  end
```

## 💾 LocalStorage Schema

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `UNIDRL_USERS` | `Array<User>` | Stores all registered user accounts, including students and administrators |
| `UNIDRL_EVENTS` | `Array<Event>` | Contains metadata of all events in the system |
| `UNIDRL_REGISTRATIONS` | `Array<Registration>` | Maintains the mapping between students and their registered events |
| `UNIDRL_CURRENT_USER` | `User \| null` | Holds session data of the currently authenticated user |
| `UNIDRL_BADGE_CONFIG` | `Object<EventId, BadgeConfig>` | Defines badge rules and post-event Q&A evaluation criteria per event |


---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### Camera not working

Ensure the application runs on `localhost` or HTTPS. Browsers block camera access on insecure origins.

### ES Module errors

Do not open HTML files directly. Always use Live Server or another local HTTP server.

### Missing styles

Check internet connection. Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN.
